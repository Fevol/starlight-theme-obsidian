description: Learn how to use the Starlight Obsidian theme in your Starlight site.
---

A [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) theme inspired by the style of [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) websites.
This project is in no way affiliated with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Various [examples](/starlight-theme-obsidian/examples/asides/) are provided to showcase changes made by the theme.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

:::caution[Warning]
This theme requires a [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) version of at least `^0.28.0` - due to the use of the i18next localization system
in several components. An [Astro](https://astro.build) version equal or higher than `^4.14.0` is also required.
:::

## Installation

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'

<Steps>
    1. The Starlight Obsidian theme is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/) that you can install using your favorite package manager:
        <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-theme-obsidian" />
    2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.
        ```diff lang="js"
            // astro.config.mjs
            import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
            import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
        +   import starlightThemeObsidian from 'starlight-theme-obsidian'

            export default defineConfig({
                integrations: [
                    starlight({
        +               plugins: [starlightThemeObsidian()],
                        title: 'My Docs',
                    }),
                ],
            })
        ```
	3. Add the Obsidian Theme [content schema](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#defining-a-collection-schema)
		to your pages to enable type checking on the page's frontmatter, you will need to
		define the `src/content/config.ts` file if it doesn't exist yet.
		```diff lang="ts"
		// content/docs/config.ts
		+	import { docsSchema } from '@astrojs/starlight/schema';
		+	import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
		+	import { pageThemeObsidianSchema } from 'starlight-theme-obsidian/schema';
		+
		+	export const collections = {
		+		docs: defineCollection({
		+			schema: docsSchema({
		+				extend: pageThemeObsidianSchema
		+			})
		+		})
		+	};
		```
    4. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview the theme in action.
</Steps>

That's it! You should now see the Starlight Obsidian theme applied to your Starlight website.

You can now further configure the theme and the graph component in the sidebar by following the [configuration](/starlight-theme-obsidian/configuration/graph/) guide.

:::note
If you want to _disable_ the graph and backlinks components which are added by default, you can do so by applying the following settings:
```diff lang="js"
// astro.config.mjs
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import starlightThemeObsidian from 'starlight-theme-obsidian'

export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [
        starlight({
            plugins: [starlightThemeObsidian({
+                   backlinks: false,
+                   graph: false
            })],
            title: 'My Docs',
        }),
    ],
})
```
