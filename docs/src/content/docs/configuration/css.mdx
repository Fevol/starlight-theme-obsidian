title: Theme Configuration

## General configuration

All of Starlight's [CSS variables](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/blob/main/packages/starlight/style/props.css) are available for
configuration, with only minimal changes to the color palette.

The only _major_ change is that the background color of the site is set to `#111213` and `#f8f9fa` for dark and light themes, respectively.
Additionally, the sidebar and navigation background color variables have been styled to match the page background.


## Setting reading width

The reading width can be easily adapted by setting the `--sl-content-width` variable.

:::note[Note]
When either of the sidebars is hidden (which happens on smaller screens), the content width will _always_ automatically expand to fill the available space,
even if it exceeds the set `--sl-content-width`.
