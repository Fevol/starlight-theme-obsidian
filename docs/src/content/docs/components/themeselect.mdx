import ThemeSelect from "starlight-theme-obsidian/overrides/ThemeSelect.astro?raw";

import { Code, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

The `<ThemeSelect>` component is an override of [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build)'s
[`<ThemeSelect>`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#themeselect),
which has been redefined to have better styling.

This component handles the switch between light and dark mode.

This code originally comes from [HiDeoo](https://github.com/HiDeoo)'s [Starlight Rapide Theme](https://starlight-theme-rapide.vercel.app/),
the original source can be found [here](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-theme-rapide/blob/main/packages/starlight-theme-rapide/overrides/ThemeSelect.astro).

## Usage

### Overriding

If you want to extend the `<ThemeSelect>` component for your own website, you can do so by creating your own override as seen below.

<Steps>
	1. Create your own `ThemeSelect.astro` component in the `src/overrides` directory (or `src/components` if you prefer).
        <Code code={ThemeSelect} lang="astro" title="src/overrides/ThemeSelect.astro" />
    2. Add the `ThemeSelect` override to your `astro.config.mjs` file.
		```diff lang="js"
		// astro.config.mjs
		import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
		import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

		export default defineConfig({
			integrations: [
				starlight({
					title: 'My Docs',
					overrides: {
						ThemeSelect: './src/overrides/ThemeSelect.astro'
					}
				})
			]
		})
		```
</Steps>
