import PageSidebar from "starlight-theme-obsidian/overrides/PageSidebar.astro?raw";

import { Code, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

The `<PageSidebar>` component is an override of both [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build)'s
[`<PageSidebar>`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#pagesidebar),
as well as [Starlight Site Graph](https://fevol.github.io/starlight-site-graph)'s
[`<PageSidebar>`](https://fevol.github.io/starlight-site-graph/components/pagesidebar)
component, which is extended to remove the Mobile Toc (which is moved to the [`<PageFrame>`](/starlight-theme-obsidian/components/pageframe) override).

This component is the one that is rendered on the right side of the page, and usually contains information
related to that specific page (such as the table of contents).

The sidebar itself does not handle any logic, if you want to hide either of the components,
there are several different ways to do so.
For more information, check out
either the [`<PageGraph>`](https://fevol.github.io/starlight-site-graph/components/pagegraph#visibility) or
[`<PageBacklinks>`](https://fevol.github.io/starlight-site-graph/components/pagebacklinks#visibility) documentation.


## Usage

### Overriding

If you want to extend the `<PageSidebar>` component for your own website, while keeping the graph and backlinks
components, you can do so by creating your own override as seen below.

Note that including the `<style>` tag is important, as none of the default styles are otherwise included.

<Steps>
	1. Create your own `PageSidebar.astro` component in the `src/overrides` directory (or `src/components` if you prefer).
        <Code code={PageSidebar} lang="astro" title="src/overrides/PageSidebar.astro" />
	2. Add the override to your `astro.config.mjs` file.
		```diff lang="js"
		// astro.config.mjs

		import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
		import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';

		export default defineConfig({
		  integrations: [
			starlight({
			  title: 'My Docs with Overrides',
		+	  components: {
		+		  // Override the theme's `PageSidebar` component.
		+		  PageSidebar: './src/overrides/PageSidebar.astro',
		+	  },
			}),
		  ],
		});
		```
</Steps>
