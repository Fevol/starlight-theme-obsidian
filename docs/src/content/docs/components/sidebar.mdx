import Sidebar from "starlight-theme-obsidian/overrides/Sidebar.astro?raw";

import { Code, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

The `<Sidebar>` component is an override of [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build)'s
[`<Sidebar>`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#sidebar), and has been
reworked to contain the website title, search bar, theme/language switcher, and social icons
(which were moved from the [`<PageFrame>`](/starlight-theme-obsidian/components/pageframe) component).

This component is the one that is rendered on the left side of the page, and contains
information about the website itself.

## Usage

### Overriding

If you want to extend the `<Sidebar>` component for your own website, you can do so by creating your own override as seen below.

<Steps>
	1. Create your own `Sidebar.astro` component in the `src/overrides` directory (or `src/components` if you prefer).
        <Code code={Sidebar} lang="astro" title="src/overrides/Sidebar.astro" />
	2. Add the `Sidebar` override to your `astro.config.mjs` file.
		```diff lang="js"
		// astro.config.mjs
		import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
		import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

		export default defineConfig({
			integrations: [
				starlight({
					title: 'My Docs',
		+			components: {
		+				// Override the theme's `Sidebar` component.
		+				Sidebar: './src/overrides/Sidebar.astro'
		+			},
				}),
			],
		})
		```
</Steps>
