import PageFrame from "starlight-theme-obsidian/overrides/PageFrame.astro?raw";

import { Code, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

The `<PageFrame>` component is an override of [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build)'s
[`<PageFrame>`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#pageframe),
which has been extended to create a new mobile bar on top of the page, which contains the
mobile table of contents (TOC), among other things.

Originally, the `<PageFrame>` component is used to render the left sidebar, page header and main content.

## Usage

### Overriding

If you want to extend the `<PageFrame>` component for your own website, you can do so by creating your own override as seen below.

Note that including the `<style>` tag is important, as none of the default styles are otherwise included.

<Steps>
	1. Create your own `PageFrame.astro` component in the `src/overrides` directory (or `src/components` if you prefer).
        <Code code={PageFrame} lang="astro" title="src/overrides/PageFrame.astro" />
	2. Add the override to your `astro.config.mjs` file.
		```diff lang="js"
		// astro.config.mjs
		import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';
		import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

		export default defineConfig({
			integrations: [
				starlight({
					title: 'My Docs',
		+			components: {
		+				// Override the theme's `PageFrame` component.
		+				PageFrame: './src/overrides/PageFrame.astro'
		+			},
				}),
			],
		})
		```
</Steps>
